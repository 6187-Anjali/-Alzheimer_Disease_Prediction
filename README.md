<h2>Alzheimer Disease Prediction using EfficientNetB0 model </h2>
EfficientNetB0 is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that balances model accuracy and efficiency using a compound scaling method. It scales depth, width, and resolution of the network uniformly, improving performance while reducing computational cost. It is the baseline model in the EfficientNet family, achieving state-of-the-art results with fewer parameters.
